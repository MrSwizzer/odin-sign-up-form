# 📝 Sign-Up Form

This project is part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum**, where I created a **Sign-Up Form** for an imaginary service. This project allows me to practice my HTML and CSS skills by building a user-friendly form interface.

## 🌟 Features

- A structured and visually appealing sign-up form layout.
- Inputs with different styles for normal, invalid, and focused states.
- A semi-transparent background behind the logo for improved text readability.
- Validation styles for password input fields.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the form and input elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and inputs.
